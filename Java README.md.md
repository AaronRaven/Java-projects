# Overview

I have developed a Java program named "Student Gradebook". It can store student name and grades. It calculates average grades and exports data to a text file. This project is part of my Java learning journey.

The program utilizes a Do-While loop for error handling and IF statements for logical checks. User choices are managed using switch-case statements. It employs ArrayList and HashMap for data storage. It can also export said data in a text file.

# Development Environment

The program was developed using the Eclipse IDE, written in the Java programming language.

 Due to nature of Java it uses quite a lot of libraries, more than Python or C++ would. Scanner imports scanner function to receive input from user. ArrayList and HasMap are used to import Data structure to store information in. FileWriter is used to export information in a text file.

# Future Work

I'm considering ways to improve this  program. I could add graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing or JavaFX for a more user-friendly experience.
For the "Add Student Grade" feature, allow users to input multiple grades for one student at once instead of entering each grade separately, which would improve efficiency.
When updating student grades, implement a feature that enables changing individual grades without deleting all existing grades for that student. This would allow the program to be much easier to use and far less tedious.

These improvements will make the program more user-friendly and efficient.
